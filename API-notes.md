### Basics

The o_C firmware operates with several "concurrent" threads.
(really they interrupt each other I guess)

There is a main _loop_ as well as an _ISR_ that fires from a timer.
The _loop_ acts as a watchdog while the _ISR_ does all the work.
UI events are on a seperate _ISR_ timer.
The display driver and input polling are also on independent interrupts.
So that's at least 4? separate processes happening in a cascade
for every cycle, which is 60us (nanoseconds) or 16.666khz

That's the general idea.

Anyway, we have top-level *Apps* and then there are *Applets* as implemented
in the _Hemisphere_ *App*. An *Applet* inherits the base class _HemisphereApplet_
and gains the superpowers necessary to live on half of your module's screen.

### Applets

There are a few different things an Applet must do:
* Controller - the main logic computed every tick (every time the ISR fires)
* View - draw the pixels on the screen (there are many helpful _gfx*_ functions)
* OnButtonPress - what to do when the encoder button is pressed
* OnEncoderMove - what to do when the encoder rotated
* OnDataRequest / OnDataReceive - how to save / load state

There is also a `Start()` function for initializing things at runtime,
plus some Help text. That's about it.

You can easily try it out by copying the `HEM_Boilerplate.ino.txt` file into place,
and then adding your computations to its skeleton.

### Applet Functions

Function? or Method? Either way, this is how you do the things.

#### I/O Functions
The main argument of each is the channel to operate on - each half of the
screen gets 2 channels. So _n_ is typically either 0 or 1.

* Clock(n) - has the digital input received a new clock pulse?
* Gate(n) - is the digital input held high?
* In(n) - Raw value of the CV input
* DetentedIn(n) - this one reads 0 until it's past a threshold ~ a quartertone
* ClockOut(n) - hold the output high for a pulse length
* GateOut(n, on_off) - set the output high or low
* Out(n, raw) - set the output to an explicit value

#### gfx Functions
There are many strategies for drawing things on the screen, and therefore, many
graphics related functions. You can see them for yourself in `HemisphereApplet.h`
All of them typically take _x_ and _y_ coordinates for the first two arguments,
followed by _width_ and _height_, or another _x,y_ pair.
_x_ is how many pixels from the left edge of the screen.
_y_ is how many pixels from the top edge of the screen.

Some essentials: *gfxPrint*, *gfxPixel*, *gfxLine*, *gfxCursor*,
                *gfxFrame*, *gfxBitmap*, *gfxInvert*
